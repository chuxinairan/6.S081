1、Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

a0~a7 registers contain function arguments, and the a2 register hold 13 in main's call to printf.


2、Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

-> 26:	45b1                	li	a1,12
in this line, the compiler calculate the return value of f() and g(), and write the immediate directly into a1.


3、At what address is the function printf located?

0x630

4、What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38
